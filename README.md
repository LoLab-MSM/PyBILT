#### PyBILT is a Python toolkit developed to analyze molecular simulation trajectories of lipid bilayers systems. The toolkit includes a variety of analyses from various lipid bilayer molecular simulation publications.

The analyses include:
   * Mean Squared Displacement (MSD)
   * Diffusion coefficent estimators (from MSD curves) - includes Einstein relation, linear fit, and anomalous diffusion fit.
   * Area per lipid estimators
   * Bilayer thickness
   * Displacement Vector (flow) maps and correlations
   * Deuterium order parameter
   * Orientation parameters
   * Mass and Electron Density Estimators
   * and more!

# Install

### Core dependencies
**PyBILT** has the following core dependencies:
   * [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) > 1.0
   * [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
   * [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
   * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
   * [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
   * [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/)
   * [future](http://python-future.org/)

### Python version support
The `pybilt` package has been tested using [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/) 3.7 and MDAnalysis=1.1.1.

### pip install
You can install the latest version of the `pybilt` package using `pip` sourced from the GitHub repo:
```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/LoLab-VU/PyBILT@v0.3.0#egg=pybilt
```
However, this will not automatically install the core dependencies. You will have to do that separately:
```
pip install MDAnalysis numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn six future
```

### conda install
First make sure you have the `conda-forge` channel in your channel list; that is the channel from which MDAnalysis is installed. You can use the following command to add it to the bottom of your channel list:
```
conda config --append channels conda-forge
```

Then you can install the `pybilt` package from the `blakeaw` Anaconda Cloud channel,
```
conda install -c blakeaw pybilt
```
The core dependencies will be automatically installed.

### Recommended additional software

The following software is not required for the basic operation of **PyBILT**, but provides extra capabilities and features when installed.

#### pytest
The `pybilt` test suite is designed to be run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), so if you want to run the tests then you will need to install pytest.

#### Jupyter
 **PyBILT** comes with a set of [Jupyter IPython notebooks](./jupyter_notebooks) which supplement the doc pages. If you want to run these notebooks locally then you will need to intall [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (or at least the IPython kernel).

Note that the notebooks have not been updated for Python 3 yet.

#### sphinx, sphinx_rtd_theme, and recommonmark
If you want to build local versions of doc pages install the following additional packages:
  * [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
  * [sphinx_rtd_theme](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  * [recommonmark](https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# Documentation and Usage

## Quick overview of PyBILT
**PyBILT** is composed of 2 primary analysis packages:
  * bilayer_analyzer -- The [bilayer_analyzer](http://pybilt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pybilt.bilayer_analyzer.html#module-pybilt.bilayer_analyzer.bilayer_analyzer) is an analysis package that
                        is designed to analyze (quasi) planar lipid bilayer
                        systems. It is accessed through the BilayerAnalyzer
                        object, which can be imported via: ```from
                        pybilt.bilayer_analyzer import BilayerAnalyzer```. The
                        BilayerAnalyzer features automatic dynamic unwrapping of
                        coordinates and leaflet detection. The bilayer_analyzer
                        works on a multiple-representation model, whereby the
                        various analyses are conducted using different
                        representations of the bilayer lipids. Bilayer lipids
                        can be represented using the following four
                        representations:
    * All atom
    * Centers-of-mass -- Each lipid (or selection of atoms from each lipid) is reduced to a
center-of-mass.
    * Grid (or lipid grid) -- The lipids are mapped to two-dimensional grids (one for each leaflet) in the
style of the [GridMAT-MD method](http://www.bevanlab.biochem.vt.edu/GridMAT-MD/)
    * Vectors - Each lipid is converted to a vector representation using select reference atoms (or sets of reference atoms) that are used to compute the head and tail of the vector; e.g., a lipid tail atom to lipid head atom, or P-N vectors.

The bilayer_analyzer features various types of analyses and the use of different
representations is handled internally based the requirements and design of each
analysis type. See the [documentation](https://pybilt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ba_analyses.html) for list of analyses that can be added to intances of the BilayerAnalyzer.   

  * [mda_tools](http://pybilt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pybilt.mda_tools.html) -- This package includes various modules and functions for directly
                 analyzing and operating on MDAnalysis trajectories and objects.
                 e.g. functions to compute density profiles.

 Additional packages include:
   * [lipid_grid](http://pybilt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pybilt.lipid_grid.html) -- The lipid grid module can be used construct "lipid grid" grid
                  representations of lipid bilayers, which can be used to
                  accurately estimate quantities such as area per lipid.

  * [com_trajectory](http://pybilt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pybilt.com_trajectory.html) -- This module can be used to construct a center of mass
                      trajectory (COMTraj) out of an MDAnalysis trajectory,
                      which is useful for computing quantities like mean squared
                      displacement. The COMTraj is designed to work with bilayers.

  * [plot_generation](http://pybilt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pybilt.plot_generation.html) -- This module has several pre-written plotting functions
                       (using matplotlib and seaborn) for some of the properties
                       that can be computed from functions in the other modules.
                       e.g. mean squared displacement and area per lipid.
## Docs
Visit the **PyBILT** docs on [Read the Docs](http://pybilt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
Docs can also be viewed offline/locally by opening the [PyBILT/docs/build/html/index.html](docs/build/html/index.html) file from the
repo in a web browser; however, this build of the docs is not updated often.

## Jupyter IPython notebooks
In addition
to the Docs, there are currently a few Jupyter IPython
[notebooks](jupyter_notebooks) that provide some examples and show some basic
usage (these have not been updated/tested for/with python 3 yet); updates and more of these are in the pipeline.
